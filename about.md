His name is Joseph Sun and I am him or he is me. I'm never quite sure how to phrase that, which must mean that neither does he. Huh. I am a full stack software engineer who focuses primarily on React and Node. My previous experience includes building web applications using Express, Node and Angular, among other technologies.



His passions include building with a purpose and increasing his productivity (like I said, weirdo-I mean, look at how he refers to himself in third person).

This is the part where I would list my good qualities (did the switch between third person to first person confuse you? It sure confused him) but I'm pretty sure everyone says the same thing (have you ever met someone who has claimed they are not hard working?). So, I'll let you fill in the blank. I am ______. That is why you should ______. Hopefully you filled in both blanks with good things.

Feel free to contact me and/or check out my work. You can find me on linkedin and github.

A software engineer who loves productivity tips and reading non-fiction. If you have the time, email me a list of books you would recommend.
A couple of my interests are USA domestic politics, economics, web development, sociology and psychology.
