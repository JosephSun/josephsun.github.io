His name is Joseph Sun and I am him or he is me. I'm never quite sure how to phrase that, which must mean that neither does he. Huh. I am a full stack software engineer who focuses primarily on React and Node. My previous experience includes building web applications using Express, Node and Angular, among other technologies.

A software engineer who loves productivity tips and reading non-fiction. If you have the time, email me a list of books you would recommend.
A couple of my interests are USA domestic politics, economics, web development, sociology and psychology.
